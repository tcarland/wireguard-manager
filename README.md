Wireguard Wrapper
=================

A tool wrapping the Wireguard CLI for creating and managing 
Wireguard tunnels.

Why the wrapper? Wireguard tunnels are easy to create and the 
CLI easily scriptable. This wrapper provides a consistent 
configuration with some reasonable defaults that allow for 
further defining a Wireguard mesh network more consistently.
